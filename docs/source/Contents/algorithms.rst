Grover's Algorithm
-------------------

Grover's Algorithm is a quantum algorithm for unstructured search that finds with high probability, the unique input given to be searched from unstructured data. The Grover's Algorithm provides a quadratic speed-up, when compared with the classical analogue of searching unstructured data. The applications of Grover's Algorithm are profound and it makes up one of the foundations in which complex quantum algorithms are built.
