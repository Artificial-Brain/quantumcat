Standard set of Gates
======================
Quantum Gates are operations that are applied to qubits, in order to effect a change in the state of qubit.
Gates are the building blocks of any quantum circuit, and it with gates that every possible utilities of quantum computers are exploited. Quantum Gates are primarily of two types
	
	1. Single qubit Gates - Gates that operate only on a single qubit
	2. Multi-qubit Gates - Gates that operate on more than one qubit.

QuantumCat supports wide array of standard gate including single qubit gates and multi-qubit gates. All the standard gates are available in IBM Qiskit, Google Cirq and AWS braket are also included in the QuantumCat platform.

QuantumCat provides the following gates as standard gates that can be imported from the QCircuit class.
