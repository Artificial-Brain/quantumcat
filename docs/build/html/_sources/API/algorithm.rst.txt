Grover's Algorithm
-------------------

Grover's Algorithm is a quantum algorithm for unstructured search  that finds with high probability, the unique input given to be searched from unstructed data. The Grover's Algorithm provides a quadratic speedup, when compared with the classical analogue of searching unstructed data. The applications of Grover's Algorithm are profound and it makes up one of the foundations in which complex quantum algorithms are built.
